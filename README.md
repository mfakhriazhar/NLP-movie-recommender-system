In todayâ€™s digital age, the vast array of entertainment content, especially movies, has grown tremendously, often making it challenging for users to find films that suit their tastes. A recommendation system serves as a valuable tool to help users discover relevant and engaging movies based on their preferences. One effective strategy for developing such a system is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP), which can comprehend and analyze descriptive data about movies, including synopses, genres, cast, and production teams. By using this content-based approach, the system can deliver more tailored and appropriate movie suggestions without depending on user interactions.

Goals:  
- Build a content-based movie recommendation system using an NLP approach.
- Combining various important information from movies to generate relevant recommendations.
- Implement TF-IDF and cosine similarity techniques to measure the similarity between movies.
- Explores movie data to understand key text characteristics that support recommendations.

Insights:  
- Importance of Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and processing text has a huge impact on the quality of recommendations generated.
- Metadata-Dependent Relevance: Movies with descriptions (overviews) and complete information provide much more accurate recommendations.
- Similarity is Not Always Perfect: Although the text is similar, it does not always result in movies with the same story feel, due to the limitations of a keyword-based approach.
- WordCloud Helps Data Understanding: Visualization of the main keywords helps understand the dominant content in the movie set.
- Handling Large Datasets: To avoid crashes due to RAM limitations, it is necessary to sample data when building cosine similarity-based models.

Conclusion:
- Simple evaluation results show that the recommendations are related to the theme or genre of the input movie.
- Overall, this project proves that the content-based approach is effective for providing personalized movie suggestions without requiring user behavior data.
